This is the website of the Workshop around emerging trends on Web Velocity and
the Web of Things (WVoT), to be held in May 2019 in San Francisco during
[TheWebConf 2019](https://www2019.thewebconf.org/).

More and more Web applications need to process data streams and/or interact
with the physical world. They perform various types of tasks among which ensure
interoperability, security and trust with physical appliances, discover device
capabilities, tame velocity by continuously processing data streams, and react
upon events. Along with results from the related scientific communities, such
as machine learning, complex event processing, and knowledge representation,
ongoing standardization processes have started to foster good practices in
these domains: RDF Stream Processing or the Web of Things (WoT). The WVoT
workshop seeks research as well as industrial productions related to one or
several of these three global areas: Data Streams on the Web, Web Velocity and
[W3C WoT Standards](https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/).
