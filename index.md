This is the website of the Workshop around emerging trends on Web Velocity and
the Web of Things (WVoT), to be held in May 2019 in San Francisco during
[TheWebConf 2019](https://www2019.thewebconf.org/).

## Call for Papers

Nowadays, more and more applications on the Web involve data streams and/or
interactions with the physical world. As such, they need to deal with various
types of tasks and related problems, among which ensuring interoperability,
security and trust with physical appliances, discovering device capabilities,
handling data flow velocity, and analysing and processing sensor streams.
Several attempts to solve these problems have emerged from different points of
view, such as machine learning, complex event processing, and semantic modeling
and reasoning. Along with results from the scientific community, ongoing
standardisation processes have started to foster good practices in these
domains, about for instance
[RDF Stream Processing](https://www.w3.org/community/rsp/) or the
[Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/) (WoT).

## Topics and Themes
This workshop aims to coalesce contributions on Web Velocity and Web of Things. 
We seek research papers, research advances and motivated
opinions, as well as industrial productions 
related to these global areas.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

### Web of Things

 - Connecting physical objects & things to the Web
 - Building Web applications and mashups of physical objects
 - Semantic interoperability and novel solutions for data integration, publication and subscription
 - Handling incomplete and noisy WoT data 
 - Distributed processing solutions for the Web of Things
 - Modelling and knowledge representation for WoT
 - Approximation approaches to process WoT data
 - Tracking provenance in the Web of Things
 - Crawling, search and discovery for Web of Things and 
 - analysing spatio-temporal data on the Web

## Important dates

| *January 20th* | Submission deadline |
| *February 14th* | Acceptance notification |
| *March 3rd* | Camera-ready version due |
| *May 13th* or *May 14th* | Workshop date |

## Submission Guidelines

We accept contributions as either short papers (3-5 pages) or long papers
(6-10 pages). Both are intended references included.

The proceedings of the WVoT workshop will be published jointly with the
proceedings of TheWebConf. Workshop papers should be no more than 10 pages in
length. Papers must be submitted in PDF according to the ACM format published
in [the ACM guidelines](www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template),
selecting the generic `sigconf` sample. The PDF files must have all
non-standard fonts embedded. Workshop papers must be self-contained and in
English.

Contributions should be submitted in EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wvot2019](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wvot2019)
