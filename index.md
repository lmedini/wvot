This is the website of the Workshop around emerging trends on Web Velocity and
the Web of Things (WVoT), to be held in May 2019 in San Francisco during
[TheWebConf 2019](https://www2019.thewebconf.org/).

## Call for Papers

Nowadays, more and more applications on the Web involve data streams and/or
interactions with the physical world. As such, they need to deal with various
types of tasks and related problems, among which ensuring interoperability,
security and trust with physical appliances, discovering device capabilities,
handling data flow velocity, and analysing and processing sensor streams.
Several attempts to solve these problems have emerged from different points of
view, such as machine learning, complex event processing, and semantic modeling
and reasoning. Along with results from the scientific community, ongoing
standardisation processes have started to foster good practices in these
domains, about for instance
[RDF Stream Processing](https://www.w3.org/community/rsp/) or the
[Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/) (WoT).

This workshop aims to coalesce contributions on these topics. We seek research
as well as industrial productions related to one or both of these global areas:
Web Velocity and W3C WoT Standards, as explained below.

### Web Velocity

### W3C Web of Things Standards

### Topics and Themes

In this workshop, we seek existing papers, research advances and motivated
opinions linked to the above areas, among which:

 - Time-series data analysis and change/pattern detection for the Web
 - Integration of WoT with social Web streams 
 - Machine learning and adaptive algorithms for analysing cyber-physical data on the Web
 - Real-time communication and interaction with IoT devices using Web technologies
 - Connecting physical objects & things to the Web
 - Building Web applications and mashups of  physical objects
 - Semantic interoperability and novel solutions for data integration, publication and subscription 
 - Crawling, search and discovery for Web of Things  
 - Publishing and analysing spatio-temporal data on the Web
 - Applications and Proof of concepts in healthcare, smart cities, industry
 - Tracking provenance in the Web of Things
 - Data compression algorithms for data stream exchange over the Web
 - Real world data/event discovery from data streams
 - Distributed processing solutions for the Web of Things
 - Modelling and knowledge representation for WoT
 - Approximation approaches to process WoT data
 - Handling incomplete and noisy WoT data 
 - Security, privacy and trust issues and solutions in the Web of Things 
 - Implementation and evaluation experiences
 - Reference datasets and proposals for benchmarks

## Important dates

| *January 10th* | Submission deadline |
| *February 14th* | Acceptance notification |
| *March 3rd* | Camera-ready version due |
| *May 13th* or *May 14th* | Workshop date |

## Submission Guidelines

We accept contributions as either short papers (3-5 pages) or long papers
(6-10 pages). Both are intended references included.

The proceedings of the WVoT workshop will be published jointly with the
proceedings of TheWebConf. Workshop papers should be no more than 10 pages in
length. Papers must be submitted in PDF according to the ACM format published
in [the ACM guidelines](www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template),
selecting the generic `sigconf` sample. The PDF files must have all
non-standard fonts embedded. Workshop papers must be self-contained and in
English.

## Accepted Papers

_To be announced on February 14th._
